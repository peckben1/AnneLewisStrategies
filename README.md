This code relies on three input files 
(found at https://als-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/fake_data/2020-07-01_17%3A11%3A00/cons.csv, 
https://als-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/fake_data/2020-07-01_17%3A11%3A00/cons_email.csv, and 
https://als-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/fake_data/2020-07-01_17%3A11%3A00/cons_email_chapter_subscription.csv)

For the code to function correctly, these files must be stored in a directory called "data" which is kept in the same directory as the code itself. 
They are Jupyter Notebook files, and as such will require Jupyter to run. They will also require Python 3 as well as the Pandas package and its prerequisites.
